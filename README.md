1.Explain what the simple List component does.

This type of component renders an unordered list of items based on the items prop passed to it and each item is represented by a <li> element

The SingleListItem component is used to render each item. And also, it is a memorized functional component that takes isSelected, onClickHandler, text, and index as props, and it renders a single list item with the given text and index, and

applies the isSelected style if the item is selected. Memorization is a technique used in React to optimize performance by caching the result of expensive function calls and returning the cached result when the inputs to the function are the same. This can help reduce the number of times a component needs to re-render and improve the overall performance of the application

The ListComponent component is responsible for rendering the list and handling the item selection. It uses the useState hook to keep track of the selected index in its state, and the useEffect hook to reset the selected index when the items prop changes. The handleClick function is called when an item is clicked and sets the selected index to the clicked item's index.

Hence, the List component provides a simple reusable list component with basic selection functionality, which can be useful in many different types of applications.
